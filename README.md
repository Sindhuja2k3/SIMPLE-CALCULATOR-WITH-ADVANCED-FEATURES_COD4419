**Title: CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Task Documentation: simple calculator with advanced features**

**Introduction:**
Welcome to the documentation for the Simple Calculator project developed as part of the internship at Codtech IT Solutions. This document provides a detailed overview of the design, implementation, and testing of a basic calculator application in Java.

**Intern Information:**
Name: Alle Sindhuja
Intern ID: COD441 

**Problem Statement:**
The goal of this project is to create a simple calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The application should have a user-friendly interface and should be implemented in Java programming language.
 
**Design and Implementation:** 
Implementation of this task involves utilising advanced java programming.
Below is the code explanation.

**Code Explanation:**

___import java.awt.*;___
It is imported to use the classes and interfaces present in java.awt package

*Frame* class is used to provide interface to calculator.

*ActionListener* is used to handle the action events

*WindowListener* is used to handle the window events

---
Button b= new Button();
---
above creates a button
button generates action event

---
TextField t=new TextField(size);
---
above creates a textfield to enter something 

---
e.setBounds( , , , ); 
---
used to set the boundaries of elements in awt

---
setLayout(); 
setBackground();
---
used to set layout and background 

---
System.exit(0);
---
Used to exit from program 

---
setText()
getText()
---
used to set and get the text in textfield

---       
Integer.parseInt(string)
---
used to convert string into integer
              
**Functionality:**
The calculator supports the following functionalities:

Addition +
Subtraction -
Multiplication *
Division /
Modulo %
Exponentiation ^
Clear clr
Unary minus (-)
 
**Testing:**
Addition of two positive and negative numbers
Subtraction of two positive and negative numbers
Multiplication of two positive and negative numbers
Division of two positive and negative numbers
Modulo of two positive and negative numbers
Clear button functionality
The tests are conducted to ensure that the calculator performs the operations correctly and handles edge cases appropriately.

**Conclusion:**
In conclusion, the task assigned to me during CodTech IT Solutions internship program involved developing a simple calculator.The implemented solution successfully accomplishes this task.This documentation provides insights into the implementation details, code explanation, functionality, etc. I had completed this task as a part of the internship program.
